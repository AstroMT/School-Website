                        <p>A church is a building used for Christian worship services and other Christian religious activities. In traditional Christian architecture the plan view of a church often forms a Christian cross; the center aisle and seating representing the vertical beam with the bema and altar forming the horizontal.

Libraries are also community hubs, where programs are delivered and people engage in learning. Modern libraries extend their services beyond the physical walls of a building by providing material accessible by electronic means, including from home via the Internet.</p>
